# Week 1

## Backlog Refinement Meeting

The larger PBI of adding site functionality was broken up into the following smaller PBI's:
- Create Jobs Functionality
- View Jobs Functionality
- Label Jobs Functionality
These PBI's were also made to be our top priority and thus put at the top of our product backlog.

The larger PBI of creating the UI/UX to our site was broken up into the following smaller PBI's:
- Creating all pages as well as their elements
- Styling all pages and their elements
- Adding extra UI/UX elements to enhance user experience (eg. animations, speeding up website)
